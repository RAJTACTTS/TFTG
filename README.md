# A Horror-Tech modpack with a large focus on FLESH and MEAT. will you survive?

## This is a semi-large modern version modpack originally inspired SCPWIKI stories like "When Day Breaks" and fleshy meaty mods. This Modpack was originally made for a group of friends, but i decided to go fully into the development, in order to see what its like making a "proper" modpack. 
## This modpack is hard, but will give you the tools neccessary to fight off any threats along the way, you will die. You will die, alot.
