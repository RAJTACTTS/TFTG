(primarily used to support the random model feature, the config screen, and allow textures set in models to vary like in OptiFine)\n\n#### Highly recommended\n- [Entity Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/entityculling): This mod does wonders for reducing entity rendering lag, doing even more than Sodium's included entity culling. This is very beneficial when using animation heavy packs like Fresh Animations.\n\n\n## Fresh Animations?\nYes.\n\nit works :)\n\n<img width=\"450\" src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/images/2f32dbeadc25e46ef6c56f0e47e5eb5d305c8ea2.png\">\n\n<br>\n\n[Download Fresh Animations](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/fresh-animations-v1-0/)\n\n\n## Features & OptiFine differences & Known Bugs\n\nUp-to-date feature details page : [Features & Optifine differences](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/blob/master/FEATURES.md)\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n> **Q:** Do all OptiFine CEM resource packs work?\n\n**A:** Most packs work fine, but I'm sure there are some exceptions, report any found issues [here](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/issues), or on my [discord](https://discord.com/invite/rURmwrzUcz).\n\n> **Q:** What's different between EMF and dorianpb's [CEM](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem)?\n\n**A:** EMF is in a complete state and has a nearly 1 to 1 parity with OptiFine CEM, EMF also does a few extra things like player animations and armor model support, with more ideas on the way :)\n\nEMF also does things differently under the hood with little to no hardcoding of support for vanilla models. Allowing full CEM support for various modded entities.\n\n> **Q:** Backports?\n\n**A:** Backports to 1.18 & 1.19 are planned.\nBackports to version 1.17 and below are not planned at this time.\n\n##

Entity Model Features 2.2","version_number":"2.2","changelog":"[2.2]\n- fixed forge 1.21 & 1.20.6 compat\n- fixed issues when used with the Sodium 0.6 betas\n- Added a setting to make EMF reset all the vanilla part transforms of player models well before every render.\n  - Only applies if custom models are present for the player.\n  - This is not the typical behaviour however with how many mods alter player animations\n  - this setting vastly reduces the difficulty of player animation compatibility between mods and animation packs.\n  - E.G. player emote mods.\n  - This compatibility still requires work on the pack makers end.\n- added the `nbt(key,test)` boolean animation function it works exactly like the nbt random property such that `models.1.SaddleItem=exits:false` will be `nbt(SaddleItem,exists:false)`\n- added boolean animation variable `is_paused` true when the game is paused\n- added boolean animation variable `is_hovered` true when the client is looking at the entity or block entity position\n- added an option in model debug settings to only render models in debug mode when the mob is hovered over\n- added a setting to control whether EMF requires a 'base' model for model variation like OptiFine *(e.g. `pig2.jem` requires a `pig.jem` to work)*. This setting is now enabled by default to promote backwards compatibility and prevent confusion.\n- tweaked the `keyframe()` & `keyframeloop()` animation functions to use catmulrom spline interpolation for smooth transitions between keyframes, factoring in the previous and upcoming frames\n- fixed villager clothing and profession textures failing to render when a texture override is set in the model\n- fixed an issue with `chest_large.jem` due to how it has to be split into 2 half models in game, this removes the log spam about the missing left/right half and also somewhat fixes animations referring to the opposite side of the chest, you are still highly recommended to keep the left and right half animations separate. A config option has been enabled to toggle this fix in case of modded chest model conflicts.\n- fixed `slime_outer` models removing translucency when using texture overrides\n- fixed `is_swinging_right_arm` and `is_swinging_left_arm`\n- added `is_using_item` true when any item is being used, usually you can detect which arm via `is_swinging_right_arm` and `is_swinging_left_arm` but this is not reliable for all item usages\n- added `is_holding_item_right` and `is_holding_item_left` to detect if the entity is holding an item in the right or left hand, may not work for all entities that hold items, only tested with players\n- added vex charging to `is_aggressive` variable and also made it potentially more consistent with modded mobs\n- fixed variation for special secondary or backup models, like `outer_armor.jem`. or old directory modded models.\n- fixed the print animation methods accidentally printing during pre-validation\n- signs and boats now have optional override models, based on how vanilla separates every sign and boat variant into its own models, these are only identifiable by enabling model creation logging and seeing what they are called there, and if absent will fallback to the optifine defaults.\n- improved the file name and location displays in the config list of all models\n- added the emf 16x logo to the config gui to replace the full logo\n- improvements to texture overrides, emf now strips redundant texture declarations to improve runtime efficiency *(e.g. ignores `pig.png` declared in `pig.jem` as its redundant)*\n- fixed an issue with some entity animation values getting reset during entity feature layer rendering and not being restored correctly","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-08-20T08:05:27.603169Z","downloads":4959,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"fae6f21c1645a6f08ff13970b3ad967417b173349e30a75afbce25fea090d15c50aa48f60961a5d350113ed30198a23be7b99d799b8d8e9f22a9e41242b20b59","sha1":"92b853daa80e8645f136785b7a1d43a0b7d74449"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/versions/vX76pGn2/entity_model_features_forge_1.20.1-2.2.jar","filename":"entity_model_features_forge_1.20.1-2.2.jar","primary":true,"size":423492,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"BVzZfTc1","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"incompatible":true},"file_name":"entity_model_features_forge_1.20.1-2.1.3.jar"},"mods\\sanitydim-mc1.20-1.1.0.jar":{"sha512":"5deb42fbf08de0191aec8105f17316cdc2089d0047bfe6bde1b8e9b9bd9d509a0fc62c67ad43b655f874bf65d18af3c64fc3a00096f95181c335e2032411718c","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"8EwpjZay","slug":"sanity-descent-into-madness","project_type":"mod","team":"hVMg8Hca","title":"Sanity: Descent Into Madness","description":"Brings the sanity mechanic from Don't Starve into Minecraft","body":"![Sanity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/croissantnova/SanityDescentIntoMadness/main/readme/sanitydim128.png)\n\n# Sanity: Descent Into Madness\n\nA Minecraft mod that brings the sanity mechanic from [Don't Starve](https://store.steampowered.com/app/219740/Dont_Starve/) into Minecraft.\n\n## Requirements\n\n<a aria-label=\"Minecraft Forge\" href=\"https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.19.4.html\">\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/Minecraft%20Forge-1.19.4--45.1.0-dfa86a?style=for-the-badge\">\n</a>\n<a aria-label=\"GeckoLib\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/geckolib\">\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/geckolib-4.2-52da6a?style=for-the-badge\">\n</a><br/><br/>\n\n**When updating, make sure to delete the config file so it's recreated and new config changes are applied.

It is _not_ required to be installed on both sides.\nIf you have Starlight on the server, clients can use Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight to connect. Likewise, if you have Starlight on \nthe client, you can connect to Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight servers.\n\nStarlight cannot be installed _with_ Phosphor, they are completely incompatible. \nBrowsing through [Starlight's Issue Tracker](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/issues \"Starlight's Issue Tracker\") will show\nfurther mod incompatibilities. Starlight is a rather destructive light engine rewrite, so it should be \nexpected to break mods more often.\n\nPurpose\n------------------\nStarlight was developed for higher scale dedicated servers, as they suffered performance problems due to how ungodly slow the\nlight engine was. The only solution was to create an extremely invasive mod which rewrote the entire light engine.\nI ported the mod to fabric so that I can update it during snapshots, and decided that publishing it for \nall users, especially client users, would be beneficial. However, it does have the downside of being an invasive mod:\nBeing invasive didn't affect higher scale servers because they run on Bukkit.\n\nFurther reading on the technical details of how Starlight achieves its performance \ncan be read here: [TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/blob/fabric/TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md \"TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md\")\n\nPerformance for 1.20:\n------------------\nHere are a few graphs showing performance in 2 areas on: Block editing at high y-levels, and normal block light updates:\n\n~~Light engine time chunk generation Graph~~ has been removed as a benchmark as it is invalid for 1.20.

A new armour set, plus existing items received further refinements. And one dangerous new regular mob, the Dragonfly Dreadnought.\n\nDRACONIC VOIDLASHER\nThe final standard dweller boss has arrived to torment the end dimension (one more wither-storm-like boss coming next).\nA monstrous hybrid between a whip scorpion and a dragonfly, it stalks you across the end dimension with teleportation abilities making it even harder to escape. Summonable with a new “block of fly flesh”, using materials now dropped by Long Legs Fly, Dragonfly Dreadnought, and Moth Moonchaser mobs.\nIt won’t spawn near the ender-dragon, so it shouldn’t be a problem until you have beaten that boss fight, in addition to warding off the Spider Moth a few times. It may sound similar to the existing Scorpioid, but they are very different.\nThe Voidlasher has an intricate system for teleporting in different situations. The lower its health is during the fight, the more frequently it teleports to nearby locations that enable it to be on the ground and do not obstruct its hotbox. When it is stalking you, it will teleport closer, somewhere around the midpoint between you and it. Therefore, if you stayed in the same place, it would teleport closer each time until it is close enough to trigger the full attack sequence, where it teleports around you. It can also teleport idly when not being attacked, mimicking enderman mobs.\nIt has a multi-stage boss fight where it can alternate between five modes, along with using multiple continuous powers.\nMode 1: Firing homing projectiles that make you vulnerable to its telekinesis. They follow you slowly, and if you let them hit you, then you are vulnerable for 9 seconds, and it will either throw you high into the air or thrash you around randomly, dealing kinetic damage.\nMode 2: Cloning itself into five copies, switching place with them randomly every few seconds so you don’t know which one is the real one (fakes disappear when hit) - plus, all of them can siphon life from a distance and give it to the real one.\nMode 3: Chaos control mode where it randomly adds temporary chaos control and chaos target effects to nearby entities, causing them to fight each other. If multiple are attacking the voidlasher, it causes them to temporarily turn on each other instead.\nMode 4: Force pull mode sucks in all nearby entities, lifting them into the air towards the voidlasher, while it also levitates itself. If you don’t escape, it can give wither effects to entities that get close.\nMode 5: Throws deadly “void spears” at enemies that deal heavy damage, cutting through armour and even projectile immunity.\n\nContinuous powers: Dangerous swirling black energy repels/damages, slows, and blinds attackers. Plus, even if you get past its telekinetic powers to attack it, it can still use its deadly whips to attack you directly, or repulse you back. Total immunity to ranged attacks, freezing projectiles midair and slowing all nearby mobs significantly except for the one it is targeting for attack.\nIt teleports around occasionally, similar to an enderman. When it gets low in health, its movement speed increases, along with its rate of teleportation.\nLike the Spider Moth, this boss and its stalking mechanism all comes in a single entity version.\nLike both other stalker bosses, it also has some creepy giant variants that can stalk you across the end dimension.\nDrops “Void Geode” item on death, used to craft extremely powerful and useful items.\n\nBrand new dangerous Dragonfly Dreadnought mob added, approximately serving as an airborne equivalent of the Spider Goliath - dropping Fly Flesh blocks. In upcoming updates, I am planning to add giant scorpion and giant spider crab minibosses.\n\nFly Appendages now dropped by Long Legs Fly and Moth Moonchaser mobs, craftable into blocks of mangled fly flesh (used for the Voidlasher’s summoning structure).\n\nNow, the five new major items all available to craft ingame!:\n- Force Gauntlet (a new primary item from the draconic voidlasher’s Void Geode, providing numerous powerful telekinesis/force abilities. These abilities work more effectively on weaker mobs, requiring less frequent cooldowns.\n- Chaos Gauntlet (the second new primary Void Geode item, providing (temporary) abilities to force mobs to fight each other instead of attacking you.\n- Vengeful Voidseeker (a new void-upgraded version of the formic fireblaster that fires homing void projectiles, or manually controllable if crouching)\n- Vitality Viewfinder (enables you to scan nearby mobs or players to get their current health percentage and maximum health points, plus if you hit an entity with it in either hand slot, it will tell you the damage of your weapon.\n- Block of Void Geode (acts like a totem of undying for nearby players, teleporting you away from any attack that would have killed you, with cooldown)\nPlus an armour-set!:\nBrand new Umbral Armour implemented as an alternative to the Infernal set!:\nArmour capable of repelling the endless void. Boots provide Immunity from falling into the void, instead levitating out to any safe location. Leggings provide jump boost, especially when sneaking, plus levitation immunity when sneaking. Chestplate provides a 50% chance to teleport away from attacks that would have otherwise killed you (with cooldown). Helmet provides immunity to blindness and nausea (infernal helmet now instead provides immunity to weakness and slowness). Set bonuses: Void shield - an automatic form of protection that harms and repels attacking mobs. Plus complete immunity to weak attacks like the infernal set, unbreakable and enchantable.\n\n\nSpider Brood abdomen model significantly improved, with more realistic baby spiders. Millipede animations and textures improved.\n\nFixed issue where Moth Moonchaser and Butterfly Bewitchers were spawning excessively and unaffected by config settings.\nFixed issue where Spider Moth could rarely spawn in the nether, and reduced the amount of my mobs that can spawn in the nether in general for enhanced performance.\n\n\nRenamed Sling Web to Silk Slinger for consistency.\n\nNew advancements added for the new items/objectives.\n\nTons of other improvements.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-07-25T15:09:11.188255Z","downloads":1399,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"25a0ff8c57c3117c5ac3b9a7f09b583a37820aae392b06f826f0b751ca90379e1dfef72a73c0a997dafebc0bbb261d304526eb74afd5e79634d2dc48dd3a1b9f","sha1":"fa4557879d5b7a9c99d94b321182d75933c11964"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/k0RPP4IO/versions/otdKrJcG/ArPhEx-3.0.1-forge-1.20.1.jar","filename":"ArPhEx-3.0.1-forge-1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":6148899,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"b7e47ce3ecffd2ab6423ad7d19ba03bd823bb0e12972011f1149fb31ae4057085428c91756c7a7893093ed8defcd4f213b48e23bed2f347978220e146d4180fe","sha1":"a076ee816dd6338971e89e692677e55d72c4ff6c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/k0RPP4IO/versions/otdKrJcG/ArPhEx-3.0.1-forge-1.19.4.jar","filename":"ArPhEx-3.0.1-forge-1.19.4.jar","primary":false,"size":6158612,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"0e6d3f8c2d99479af32b38bc3c5a3795b5ec8d685a5804d6635a7393a70e2b0047f2f258207a901e830073a96e34d0b61c7a0e86ee540f006fba5483dfc90f89","sha1":"f040a6305e2faf91d4e5de13792309f1e1400dd5"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/k0RPP4IO/versions/otdKrJcG/ArPhEx-3.0.1-neoforge-1.20.4.jar","filename":"ArPhEx-3.0.1-neoforge-1.20.4.jar","primary":false,"size":6135796,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"22c83f0df58e8c59706a75a1267ea7c27ca72f48","sha512":"0afe66f79fab3d2ae2c98dd850f54acbfa4c2182bae5142a9744d1aa44d34c75d708b391a7fa477cfa92a5457b37c7d53527ae45812a58dd2b8f96fe1e690a37"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/k0RPP4IO/versions/otdKrJcG/ArPhEx-3.0.1b-forge-1.19.2.jar","filename":"ArPhEx-3.0.1b-forge-1.19.2.jar","primary":false,"size":6200292,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"8BmcQJ2H","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"A8rzsSSb","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"KpICtuVx","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"BIgcJD4v","user":{"id":"jt1puCih","username":"vllaxa","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/jt1puCih/bb61960f89fcb26ad88b8f85e252ddbff5ca8b75.webp","bio":null,"created":"2024-04-23T06:35:34.491048Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ArPhEx-3.0.1-forge-1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\nightlights-1.20.1-1.1.jar":{"sha512":"803c5e7a2f07584d9c3308d380d8be4e135f0045e2c910d4fd5909e3e5ac33b79c3cad5ba609909346e52df4c678139bd0614f22293b29bd0ac10c23fcdf622a","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"s7pMb898","slug":"nightlights","project_type":"mod","team":"pvbuXBPL","title":"Night Lights","description":"A mod that adds a variety of new light sources to Minecraft!","body":"<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/uniS9UM.png\" width=\"1127\" height=\"276\" alt=\"Night Lights\">\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/52LU4mv.png\" width=\"86\" height=\"23\" alt=\"About\">\n\nThis mod will add a variety of new decorative light sources to your game, from fairy lights to night lights!<br><br><span>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/a_4T-7BOqCY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

What is Spooklementary?\n\n* Spooklementary, by SpacEagle17, is an edit of EminGT's [Complementary Shaders](https://www.complementary.dev/). \n* It is a horror-themed shaderpack that transforms your game into a moody and spooky experience.\n* Perfect for Halloween or scary maps!

We want to introduce new players to atlas, and make it easier to maintain and improve.<br/>\n`0.x` uses arch, keeps the old `antiqueatlas` ID, and is API-compatible with [tyra's port](https://modrinth.com/mod/antique-atlas).<br/>\n`1.x` uses fabric, and is API-incompatible with 0.x.<br/>\n`2.x` uses fabric and [Surveyor](https://modrinth.com/mod/surveyor) - and is save/API/network/respack-incompatible with older versions.<br/>\n\nOnce stable and feature-complete, we intend to maintain atlas on most modpack versions >=1.18.2 ([more info](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/issues/81))\n\n## Afterword\n\nAll mods are built on the work of many others.\n\nThe art for antique atlas was created by [Hunternif](https://github.com/Hunternif) ([DA](https://www.deviantart.com/hunternif)) and [lumiscosity](https://github.com/lumiscosity) ([Neocities](https://lumiscosity.neocities.org/)).<br/>\n[Click here](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/blob/1.20/credits.txt) for detailed art credit.\n\nThis mod is a fourth-gen rewrite, and relies heavily on contributions of many developers and artists before us.<br/>\nWe can't draw autotile to save our lives - feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atexturing)!\n\nThis mod is included in [Tinkerer's Quilt Plus](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt) - our modpack about rediscovering vanilla.\n\nWe're open to suggestions for how to implement stuff better - if you

Designed for better user experience and API.\n\nJade can be installed only on the client side. But many features require Jade on the server side. (item storage, horse stats, bees in beehive...)\n\n**For mod integration, try Jade Addons: [Forge](https://modrinth.com/mod/jade-addons-forge)  [Fabric](https://modrinth.com/mod/jade-addons-fabric)**\n\n### Keys (default):\n\n - Keypad 0: Open configuration screen\n - Keypad 1: Toggle overlay\n - Keypad 2: Toggle liquid display\n - Keypad 3: Show recipes (Requires JEI)\n - Keypad 4: Show uses (Requires JEI)\n - Keypad 5: Narrate target\n\n### Notable changes compared to Hwyla:\n\n - API re-design\n - More vanilla addons\n - Higher configurability\n - Better accessibility\n\n[![Interested in supporting me and the development of mods?

This mod will impact your FPS, but many steps have been taken to reduce the performance cost without overhauling Minecraft’s rendering engine.\n\nIf the mod reduces your FPS too heavily, check the config file for its many settings. The most impactful options are to reduce the lightRefreshRate and to disable smoothBlending.\n\nVideo\n-----\n<iframe  height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MEnFfeZzMsg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nMod Conflicts\n-------------\n\n* Optifine: It will work, although some dynamic lighting will behave strangely if Optifine’s dynamic lighting is enabled.\n* Rubidium (Tested in 1.18.2/1.19.2): Dynamic lighting will work, but emissive textures won’t. Sometimes crashes if there's a lot of dynamic lighting happening.\n* Flywheel (Tested in 1.19.2): Dynamic lighting behaves weirdly with blocks rendered through Flywheel's backend. Turning their backed off in the config fixes this, at the cost of performance. Emissive block textures won’t work at all, and may look weird on Create contraptions. Warnings will appear on the first world load with Lucent installed if you have Flywheel.\n\nMod Support (1.19.2 and up)\n---------------------------\n\n* [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create)\n* Resource packs may define conditional dynamic lighting for entities and items, utilizing various bits of data about the light source to control how much light should be emitted. Additional conditions may be used to define things like if a light source works underwater or not.\n* The API has been expanded, allowing for custom render pipelines to access data about dynamic lighting and emissive textures.\n\nMod Support (1.18.2 and up)\n---------------------------\n\n* Resource packs may define simple dynamic lighting for entities and items.\n\nMod Support (1.17 and up)\n-------------------------\n\n#### Dynamic Lighting:\n\n* [Lava Monster](https://modrinth.com/mod/lava-monsters)\n* [Nethercraft](https://modrinth.com/mod/nethercraft)\n* [Blue Skies](https://modrinth.com/mod/blue-skies)\n* [Miner's Helmet](https://modrinth.com/mod/miners-helmet)\n* [Quark](https://modrinth.com/mod/quark)\n\n#### Other\n\n* [Catalogue](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/catalogue) GUI\n* [Configured](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/configured) GUI\n\n🤷 FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions\n-----------------------------------\n\n### Doesn’t Optifine do this already?\n\nThere is dynamic lighting in Optifine, however it is NOT open-source. Lucent’s dynamic lighting has been completely written from scratch and is open-source, aimed for modpacks and developers that want to work with Lucent’s API for smooth dynamic lighting. Optifine CANNOT be distributed on CurseForge or Modrinth, so for those creating modpacks, who want dynamic lighting right out of the box, Lucent is great for modpack creators.\n\n---\n\n**🤚 Support: If you have questions or any issues with our mods, read the FAQ!

This is a library mod, it does not add anything on its own.\n\nI do not recommend other modders to build on this as I will ruthlessly break backwards-compatibility as needed for my mods.\n\nNote that this is not a magic solution for running Forge and Fabric mods together, it's only a library my mods will depend on to make publishing for both versions easier.\n\n## Why is this?\n\nI can't just switch to Fabric and abandon all existing Forge users, but I also don't want to miss a Fabric train if there is one.\n\nTrying a port for fun showed that most of the platform-specific things can easily be hidden away from the actual mod code which doesn't have to care about modloader backends, which should hopefully make it much easier to support both mods at the same time.\n\nThere's other libraries that do the same thing, but given the amount of mods I maintain I don't want to put all my money on one boat only to deal with headaches once those other mods stop being supported.\n\n## How does this?\n\nIt just wraps all platform-specific code behind a unified API (in the simplest way possible, there is no magic involved) and provides superclasses to use in cases where platform-specific methods are added to Vanilla classes.\n\nIt also adds a simple network system (similar to Forge's) and a config layer with sync support.\n\n## Who is this?\n\nHi, I'm Blay and my Twitter is at

On","description":"Carry On allows you to pick up Tile Entities and Mobs and carry them around!","body":"Ever wonder why you can carry a stack of 64 empty chests in your pocket, but you can’t move a filled one with your bare hands? Well, wonder no more!\n\nCarry On is a simple mod that improves game interaction by allowing players to pick up, carry, and place single block Tile Entities (such as Chests, Furnaces, Droppers, Spawners, and your favorite machines from other Tech Mods) using only their empty hands. No items (or pickaxes) required. States, meta data, inventory and NBT data are retained. It also allows you to carry around smaller mobs!\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n- Shift (can be rebound) + Right-Click (with Empty Hands) on any Tile Entity or mob to lift and carry\n- Right-Click to place\n\n![Carry On Demo](https://www.creeptech.net/carryon/carryondemo2.gif)\n\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/PJ4Q7tp.gif)\n\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/czlzu1s.gif)\n\n\n**Other features:**\n\n- Works with single block Tile Entities from any mod (yes, tech mods too)\n- Works with all entities (no hostile mobs in survival mode, configurable)\n- Entities can be stacked on each other (only smaller entities on top of larger ones)\n- Respects the ‘lock’ functionality so Tile Entities cannot be stolen\n- Powerful config allows you to blacklist entire mods or specific blocks, and additional customization\n- Players can only carry one Tile Entity or Mob at a time, and are prevented from other actions when carrying\n- Carrying a Tile Entity or Mob slows the player. Items with fuller inventories and larger mobs will cause additional slowness\n- Advanced scripting for modpack creators. Wiki [here](https://github.com/Tschipp/CarryOn/wiki/Scripting).\n- If you can't place down a picked up block, you can remove it from your inventory with /carryon clear\n- Players can also be carried\n\n**Config Options:**\n\n- Carry On provides a powerful config file, wiki [here](https://github.com/Tschipp/CarryOn/wiki/Model-Override-Config)\n- Specific blocks or entire mods can be blacklisted\n- An option to carry standard blocks (e.g., Dirt) can be enabled (Default = Off)","published":"2022-12-05T21:45:11.691063Z","updated":"2024-08-21T08:04:38.240315Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1504691,"followers":1079,"categories":["game-mechanics","storage","transportation"],"additional_categories":["utility"],"game_versions":["1.12.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["WaUwGT7r","aPthYrcV","4taUKxre","ibq5WYnJ","IA7TXsjL","CGK8S9Jc","FS0TPQOn","HMCz7mpi","Tpvzh1n7","CS0T5Zjr","HSrAkWqH","fk6vR3rB","zFYERXVc","F6ZR4jay","QAiSN3Q8","IJ5gr5ow","cE4GdBxS","67jN6bxd","SXmDVLN0","4GE3aVyX","o4LGtvUQ","2jx3bUuL","BycIzhuF","uGbxgawj","LwNYnVxa","NyGIRVfz","1soFLh2H","gq4gg8ZY","fgecxyFN","TNZ4Ah0o","epf47Jaz","f48u7DLZ","i8cp4wxM","u8IQu6NU","TxQzQgUm","tofYc8B0","aKYuUZpd","5QeqM4nf","fg9VeABy","nc5Z9l3C","x5FGVS4q","LTOqV1Cw","iX4EV3eP","9iomDg8D","uemV3oEm","uh2S7w5K","tHTJYcot","e6FYVr4k","6pIQMDen","SgeYUS6n","edGQD16r","Mkla4B3q","AlPBrFTW","CE3MquDi","J7qT9hJD","DjVumdix","EvDx8gEe","8a6KfB5j","b33iu1N6","85jjKm7u","7FcWNYcV","xsWKlT1A","lSa8MVef","v6jFgMGH","2LfOJ5LW","ZViMsjtX","IHa8cQoR","79dpvD0M","TuSZSQeB"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/joEfVgkn/d07cc032da5a9854489ab5ae443c91c1147792bc.png"},"version":{"id":"edGQD16r","project_id":"joEfVgkn","author_id":"5I09DlLz","featured":false,"name":"Carry On 2.1.2.7","version_number":"2.1.2.7","changelog":"- Fixed Memory Leak\n- Updated default Blacklist\n- Fixed crash with Rats","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-19T22:29:28.090790Z","downloads":286029,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"9999714ca3dd2f2401f0396ca44f3b27c3784c4f","sha512":"4f75afb703dd71c322d4e2e27d28d7ab4afeb0c242bcee6d1eb5fef59ee4347352f1ca55f1826743957d2e95a951ed13884356485b0a979b14010915079e2c29"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/joEfVgkn/versions/edGQD16r/carryon-forge-1.20.1-2.1.2.7.jar","filename":"carryon-forge-1.20.1-2.1.2.7.jar","primary":true,"size":439457,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"4y59IILI","user":{"id":"5I09DlLz","username":"Tschipp","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11649893?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-12-05T21:43:38.882316Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"carryon-forge-1.20.1-2.1.2.7.jar"},"mods\\Bookshelf-Forge-1.20.1-20.2.13.jar":{"sha512":"1143753a001bccb3fc84c699cc93343f1941da9b7a63d3a3b8078808262b42962f8b10a2c16ed97a49c058865a6dbaa7e85a1e8842b95039d222f06ab4ee9509","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"uy4Cnpcm","slug":"bookshelf-lib","project_type":"mod","team":"qdYl5sw1","title":"Bookshelf","description":"An open source library for other mods!","body":"<p>Bookshelf is a collection of code, frameworks, utilities, and other resources.

FPS","description":"Reduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.","body":"# Dynamic FPS\n\nReduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.\n\n## Features\n\nDynamic FPS will detect whether the Minecraft window is currently active, being hovered over, unfocused, or invisible.  \nFor each of these states you're able to adjust the frame rate, volume, and whether [toast notifications](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Toasts) are temporarily paused.\n\nYou can also configure these settings for when you're idling (with a custom timeout) or while your laptop / handheld is on battery.  \nOptionally you may also display the current battery status on the in-game HUD and receive toast notifications about battery activity.\n\n---\n\nIn addition to this Dynamic FPS fixes a vanilla bug causing higher-than-necessary background CPU usage and stops\nrendering the world while it's being obscured by resource loading overlay, helping especially on low-end systems.\n\n## Installation\n\nDynamic FPS is available for download on [GitHub](https://github.com/juliand665/Dynamic-FPS/releases), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamic-fps), and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-fps).  \nTo access the in-game config screen you'll also need to install [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config).\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n- Why is Minecraft still running at 15 FPS?\n\nDynamic FPS will only slow the client render loop to a minimum of 15 cycles per second.\nLower frame rates are achieved by then cancelling the rendering of all superfluous frames, e.g. 14 out of 15 frames are cancelled for 1 FPS.\n\nThis lets you resume playing almost instantly after switching back to the game:\nInstead of having to wait for up to a second until the next rendered frame comes along, the game checks back within 1/15th of a second.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nEnabling the battery integration requires downloading an additional library at runtime.  \nThe mod contains the hashes for these files ahead of time and will verify them before usage.\n\nYou may disable this behavior in the mod's settings, or [install the library yourself](https://github.com/juliand665/Dynamic-FPS/blob/main/docs/manual-natives-install.md) if you wish.\n","published":"2020-12-01T15:57:46.862046Z","updated":"2024-08-22T12:42:42.674431Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":6676995,"followers":4202,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.2-pre1","1.16.2-pre2","1.16.2-pre3","1.16.2-rc1","1.16.2-rc2","1.16.2","1.16.3-rc1","1.16.3","1.16.4-pre1","1.16.4-pre2","1.16.4-rc1","1.16.4","20w45a","20w46a","20w48a","20w49a","20w51a","1.16.5-rc1","1.16.5","21w03a","1.17","1.17.1-pre1","1.17.1-pre2","1.17.1-pre3","1.17.1-rc1","1.17.1-rc2","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1-pre1","1.18.1-rc1","1.18.1-rc2","1.18.1-rc3","1.18.1","22w03a","22w05a","22w06a","22w07a","1.18.2-pre1","1.18.2-pre2","1.18.2-pre3","1.18.2-rc1","1.18.2","1.19","22w24a","1.19.1-pre1","1.19.1-rc1","1.19.1-pre2","1.19.1-pre3","1.19.1-pre4","1.19.1-pre5","1.19.1-pre6","1.19.1-rc2","1.19.1-rc3","1.19.1","1.19.2-rc1","1.19.2-rc2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1-rc1","1.20.1","23w31a","23w32a","23w33a","23w35a","1.20.2-pre1","1.20.2-pre2","1.20.2-pre3","1.20.2-pre4","1.20.2-rc1","1.20.2-rc2","1.20.2","23w40a","23w41a","23w42a","23w43a","23w43b","23w44a","23w45a","23w46a","1.20.3-pre1","1.20.3-pre2","1.20.3-pre3","1.20.3-pre4","1.20.3-rc1","1.20.3","1.20.4-rc1","1.20.4","24w09a","24w10a","24w11a","24w12a","24w13a","24w14potato","24w14a","1.20.5-pre1","1.20.5-pre2","1.20.5-pre3","1.20.5-pre4","1.20.5-rc1","1.20.5-rc2","1.20.5-rc3","1.20.5","1.20.6-rc1","1.20.6","24w18a","24w19a","24w19b","24w20a","24w21a","24w21b","1.21-pre1","1.21-pre2","1.21-pre3","1.21-pre4","1.21-rc1","1.21","1.21.1-rc1","1.21.1","24w33a","24w34a"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["kurPEwi6","gVvtLF6M","XlBOTUIQ","muZxaaxq","oIZUkvvs","RgJGw0dO","Co2w6nIh","LttnLLIj","g9FOSLTq","tChVqk53","Usg995P0","Dfw5rXkQ","8feSMAfR","BRhzFUHi","NzEhyQyc","hWM6qcqA","sejsYSOg","53FTYNg4","8ZK3Yrx8","5LX1Blqr","gi2eS21F","NeKJoURy","3WUIXnPq","MT0Hhrmt","xJziTz7j","KBaicJn7","MJxmQ042","HyfaQLUy","ufaW1r8S","1npK5wCt","apxb2RCR","k6MHtC5D","QLkpv8Ld","5NDr40VW","qU25ZOM2","e2GoOHqC","LLW6Rz4X","tBXQeb6B","PdOcOZe5","IC26VVbo","aIfiOstF","6XTTKHFs","wOSxC0Zb","lffwyl3t","EqKUlwIM","E8I4fCdF","TiEIglop","6ZZnpiKt","RaQsEbig","IntaQuNq","8zD1HoDT","cBDPkvTM","kmNGyLFl","lHhemLYM","JzqaccpR","DIVSdFSY","ON9j8VE4","OeMT2cC8","ksK11lcD","Ec4NqAob","XzHVv85p","nLicebq0","OZ1kEY2A","2A0fjGIj","UL1yMXMO","RdFrLKPC","v2hnzsRt","9ItmBJnL","eghSjWeK","mwACShkf","tpCuDULl","IORbL2mx","EhV5xUXs","tGTBddY1","yhhpGEhV","QBGkeC7m","4YGsF2sR","XGwn4gNc","THG0PVdn","9HB3KfC8","PnFGjxcb","3eTIv2kA","CD4gyQlk","qU5QelCK","akci2PEc","hdO7gDw8","xRLXdhYl","xCKeVizz","O7a5N5VT","SsL3jQXt","r8rpH64x","eGHFlVzX","pR3KcCvX","E4fdZphD","RRLjJEKm","tQFy1FeZ","vGmLfA3R","khb32G0k","ZvR7ufZu","lfIMkupj","Jwsj9hnw","n9joHa1e","lW5W9ena","kWB5Orlp","YoeLPRqx","6HsZEX1E","shfvdKKK","NhH3bdcX","Obc6GFkK","AEjABoYz","c9Pa2Sap","qPlkTrvl","5VqjJ4M6","SMbXVy9A","3DtySnI3","KB42DIPY","4GgVhh2s","nGi7w36N","8qMOAA4B","pQo2WjRY","2mbM4NFn","33B4KCsj","NSmsdNiu","g3gquqif","FWwfvgYH","dgeCtXsu","fY95HR8z","48hFxWw7","M9XF5FlW","AK9FBEgo","BJSHfipe","y3LKh1gi","tqCNpIoc","tBrRMDS7","5U2bHbH6","rD3FWXH7","OpDYYPhR","jeq5Pk2P","TsACcqoR","zABNE034","RS3zegai","RCY49qLv","GzuwoJDO","U0tp6QIQ","mUoNvE18","ANanuCGR","XNQmNGUo","H3jM6EoR","aM6FmhY7","TLSV8m3h","LF4zDKeR","MbErXFSW","F7x3PReU","z9Xj6TuQ","NU3HRHXj","PyDPmXHD","wzp3skkc","aPRTCnlc","5fk6vDb1","U1cZ1TL7","8Hd00M1M","OjAim4Jo","ESoagl4C","pHWNKS7t","BNf9EmNl","JRl3y7rm","tEiWfX1N","uHnzIEQj","dliDieeY","wBsh7vqV","YF37wYKK","FonmH7YD","nTdQW3oL","KEs1F4M2","pMITUDDN","RYTZvQBc","TSSDSiZP","kbiP4CMi","qRc80r3o","jdsdQwkB","6FJB6Cff","DdDJ86cX","Xd3OWazo","eRegd530","jVjy8fjK","aLCEN12X","lSXJY9xl","FFFxotk0","JiiW7oPc","LlYJQJc0","imrXtkp1","GCbqf3Es","FxizL9t5","1nYqpxqz","ks5hKqn1","t4XJUfdJ","TfKF27MT","9gdFVbPJ","LP8Tu8Ll","G9r3hXu4","b1zBQl0B","5e8bQR5b","lb0ERSTU","zVtEuiz1","mXDQxXwm","dXkCBME4","oFct4NKJ","WJuoKsuM","AhFXokhh","QzrbOBED","sOzoK2fb","d6n6Sb6I","5W8VDiH4","a2IbMyKC","sEzImHwf","h06Upukv","Pcmh7OK0","tHSt3yUI","qfUfpOBS","iSAuMKvE","xQUOTslP","XAe7mdMi","4T8GrChY","P279QZmx","9RQmLH9X","9Z8wC7Bs","sA9AN6iB","4UrwSLvV","yHvN9viy","hqTdt4bl","5P9Foxif","SsKRtIyS","R1Otz1WG","K3llA9y2","UZugeJO9","3MCj6qoZ","TwDvMMdE","u3GllwCC","PKPrwsmh","DyKTQ9qw","iaFlHFEr","Ao8PBvh6","FbNkaZBJ","k43Gdwy2","zYXfsqA5","5TxkcmeE","X5VTy6uf","Lvh11xC8","xXDq3Ptc","GtitXgiZ","MO25GW56","7sQlugss","D4YOJGoV","wKxQLFIt","qKKrOWrO","flIO89c2","RZDYy0mt","iPggdyUp","6h1tu8Mr","JLiyLuHa","GGeYe3vC","vSb6nnhw","SyA5ADUs","qqblKu56"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LQ3K71Q1/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"MO25GW56","project_id":"LQ3K71Q1","author_id":"HXiopoLj","featured":false,"name":"v3.6.3","version_number":"3.6.3","changelog":"-

It's just a mod that adds the white ash particle from the Basalt Deltas biome to the underground to simulate dust!

This allows for much more advanced and flexible sensors\n\n<h3>Advanced behaviours</h3>\n\nUtilise built-in, or create new behaviours based on an extensible behaviour class, which builds in callbacks, predication, cooldowns, and more.\n\n<h3>Runtime-safe behaviour modification</h3>\n\nAdd, remove, and modify behaviours dynamically from an existing entity.\n\n<h3>Optimisation</h3>\n\nSBL replaces almost the entirety of the vanilla brain system's functions, using high-efficiency functions to remove the inefficiencies in as many areas as possible of the brain. Done right, an SBL entity could be even more efficient than one using goals!\n\n<h3>Additional sensors, behaviours, and memory types</h3>\n\nSBL builds in additional modules for use in any entity, with more to come over time.\n\n<h3>Added utility functions</h3>\n\nAs well as the expected brain functionality, SBL additionally adds additional helpers, such as:\n<ul>\n<li>Optimised level entity-getter functions</li>\n<li>Developer-friendly Random library</li>\n<li>Brain interface utility for adding/removing brain content from non-SBL entities</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How do I use it?</h2>\n\nThe library is documented on its <a href=\"https://github.com/Tslat/SmartBrainLib/wiki\">Wiki Page</a>\n\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n\nIf you have issues or want to contribute, please jump on the <a href=\"https://github.com/Tslat/SmartBrainLib/issues\">Github Page</a> and make your voice heard","published":"2022-12-17T12:17:52.593792Z","updated":"2024-08-23T04:39:58.000133Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":478823,"followers":117,"categories":["library","mobs","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["exjazZDg","71op6HqT","ysll7HpR","eO2xepQK","yg06oOBL","uvicGZEz","M7ktWGYQ","edbi1MqI","dwBqdXTr","mVxYjt2C","UV85Isda","TPUuRqId","7N07DeJa","5fHkAtan","a8k5dfeM","YtIoSE8Z","kIHNFgnN","LEkLts9l","nKzUoyO8","eyTnm1To","YuXSOitO","bLpKjCaQ","iKI7O10v","5cfIbMqV","j5XWlgk3","ItbW1raD","JI1HW5g1","l1gfkZbZ","Okj48Ibk","61jQHgGB","R8SV4kEf","diQfXwzz","TQ4ys3Av","rAWSa9XC","AzORYDU1","FH1MNWFQ","RC9fgR3J","mAriNnAC","EB0jfrC5","4XxIY1BG","F112BW8M","YJrpYN13","blvJQFdb","hww2X4x4","VgKI4whr","pcIY8pUw","QmXwJzyR","FGnzv2Lk","IBB8LO6M","Sf934AXj","6m8aUEBx","Wiuu8JU7","qNnjjZzo","QvPn3aLF","oLNiEUfG","KAMi0Ept","4p96t8Yd","zhZ3UUw6","aLYIaCqo","JJ4nopDF","rMDWa1ai","RLMA7zfB","9OZ7OJ3s","d5rNlXJS","vUPsJnRv","KtPqX3wy","mY9xu8va","oxXdjo3N","GPn70ZjT","A9OMmXN4","YcFmK3E8","Ki2pVyn2","Z4JV31SC","WPExnI9I","ZVT3Ovi9","MlmfuNAV","ZLWE52gx","a40zhjmt","4r56AcMw","j5TLOZUR","jnjeZofb","oBH3gOjh","HsBvnqEk","ghHJdLd3","XsqXgUo1","YkeJNm33","ft0ElRBl","EPH5uBb1","yvDq9ewJ","g8hsynIg","MgT6lGFk"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/PuyPazRT/622163918cf3b62f4f0172962ac4205030e7074a.png"},"version":{"id":"oBH3gOjh","project_id":"PuyPazRT","author_id":"GIhCykJ9","featured":false,"name":"1.14.2","version_number":"1.14.2","changelog":"No changelog was specified.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-07-08T11:14:03.168215Z","downloads":14116,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"223e56ffd6ab9ac5f388e155d4603df5a8bf95bdf841c018fe67d5df26209646bfbf2d958a02c0c208bb7e8ac01f24ae893301dd31c2dc0614c6703e10655ed1","sha1":"4ab2752df9158438317e6b4b6754fc0bd092ca7e"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/PuyPazRT/versions/oBH3gOjh/SmartBrainLib-forge-1.20.1-1.14.2.jar","filename":"SmartBrainLib-forge-1.20.1-1.14.2.jar","primary":true,"size":359083,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"DSfXxkQM","user":{"id":"GIhCykJ9","username":"Tslat","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7098525?v=4","bio":"I am person, do things.","created":"2021-07-22T02:03:12.915903Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":{"id":"YkeJNm33","project_id":"PuyPazRT","author_id":"GIhCykJ9","featured":false,"name":"1.15","version_number":"1.15","changelog":"No changelog was specified.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-08-23T04:22:55.344970Z","downloads":190,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"366e0f0c7ca746fee327392d3569b31aefd34b5a","sha512":"51754d743b86bf89da5c15a1c2b733f4b3713bf2aa7e6bd4d920cd36bc7923f2de316903fbe0d675a37f848929508c0e418dec1ecf7e87342f547fe32e75f8f4"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/PuyPazRT/versions/YkeJNm33/SmartBrainLib-forge-1.20.1-1.15.jar","filename":"SmartBrainLib-forge-1.20.1-1.15.jar","primary":true,"size":362339,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"incompatible":true},"file_name":"SmartBrainLib-forge-1.20.1-1.14.2.jar"},"mods\\foglooksmodernnow-1.2.1.jar":{"sha512":"06fd4175696190f04e708617676a6aac1d903effbc629614c3b1a533f504a65877e6e9002de0fd353f4a1190adb4f388229f90a8533cb549ab9bbee88a4248d7","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"3jtC58cg","slug":"fog-looks-modern-now","project_type":"mod","team":"S820VWP9","title":"Fog Looks Modern Now","description":"Helps fog look better by moving the fog start closer.

Its goal is to bring the two platforms closer together, saving\ndevelopers time and effort maintaining their mods for multiple platforms at once, as well as allowing players to play\nall their favourite mods in one modpack.\n\nAlso check out [Forgified Fabric API](https://github.com/Sinytra/ForgifiedFabricAPI), a port of Fabric API to NeoForge.  \nTo learn more about how Connector works, you can read our [Introductory blog post](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/discussions/11).\n\n## 📋 Usage Guide\n\nTo install Connector and its dependencies, follow the same installation steps as you would for any other mods:\n1. If you haven't already, install NeoForge. We recommend using the latest stable version.\n2. Download the latest release of Connector and drop the jar in your mods folder.\n3. Following that, you'll want to download the [**Forgified Fabric API**](https://modrinth.com/mod/forgified-fabric-api). It is meant to be a direct *replacement* for the Fabric API and is not compatible with it. We'll try our best to avoid loading the Fabric API if it's installed automatically (e.g. by your modpack manager), but if you have the option to do so, don't install it.\n4. Now that you have all dependencies installed, grab your favourite Fabric mods and **just drop them in the mods folder** like you would with any Forge mods. Connector will handle loading them for you with no additional steps required.\n\n## 🔍 Get help\n\nIf you're having trouble running a mod on Connector, open our [Mod Compatibility Thread](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/discussions) and check if it lists your mod as incompatible. If it's not listed, please open a new issue in Connector's repository on GitHub.\n\nHere's a few tips to follow when reporting issues:\n1. Make sure you are using latest available version. Look for existing issues that might've already been answered / fixed. Think about whether the issue is caused by Connector itself and not another mod you've installed. To test this, try reproducing the same issue on Fabric.\n2. Navigate to [the issues tab](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/issues) and open a [new issue](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/issues/new/choose). Select one of the available templates depending on the topic. Fill in the required fields. In order to increase our chances of identifying and reproducing the issue, please make sure to include as many details as possible.\n3. Once you're done describing the problem, submit the issue.

The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2024-08-20T14:23:41.715125Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":11720509,"followers":6137,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.7.10","1.8.8","1.8.9","1.12.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn","17Hi340V","BDwHAdWc","1MBmcSf1","LwvhfrTE","tUVHg6HN","pVb6ajsR","DkksI437","KSu61vcB","Ek0VIX9q","mBYyh1qv","HSirwtwV","2I1m95aJ","M5k1QJL1","knltv3Vh","iC2A1KnJ","McVB9vXT","7JR5qJ8f","dmSSEQmZ","l1SLPhB6","bpznplxY","sXviAk4G","SLiFyIon","bketoxVs","frGGaFrx","gO8hxcyv","ugIRhLoi","2LyjkgAv","PG8gMKcT","4Nq7hEtl","hyejM5za","SzEdoick","UHcskdEO","92bPVm5F","DHBIGCNn","F3RXDl1W","TOyoOLwn","7ZgGD02s","KRGWwoZW","1LVdHUaX","3VAtIiWX","cj8nR3eG","VgDjay7P","p2L3IXut","6U5rh26a","Gggee1My","LXLEbjiC","Bu3hSiJb","KGMvyJTe","mahLIqpj","haJ4L3vJ","lil4k3tE","7F6Kp0Ay","HZeMEZEy","vg0SC4Y7","xWH6Uo7w","iqty9WKv","opQrd8FA","17GdZTv7","iVUgWfyD","VgprkY4E","uh3DtMnM"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"DHBIGCNn","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":false,"name":"1.6.6-1.20.1 - Forge","version_number":"1.6.6","changelog":"## Changes\r\n* Update to 1.21\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/compare/1.6.5...1.6.6","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-14T21:18:53.168177Z","downloads":305238,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"0d4c1262af012d8bc18acbf7640fe05f20bbd007410160b404c94b409997e8df1230bd851bcc21697938b24f2237a62c025db68fe61aadde316b490d76b73b75","sha1":"cc2e44cd3260f98ef35297854e5154a36add36cc"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/versions/DHBIGCNn/entityculling-forge-1.6.6-mc1.20.1.jar","filename":"entityculling-forge-1.6.6-mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":71139,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"hLPrl6Gq","user":{"id":"poie5Iwy","username":"vicisacat","name":"vicisacat","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/poie5Iwy/107197d35f2df9a1b4f3f2c09ccbe65a1df9bd82.png","bio":"I made the Entity Culling port for beta 1.7.3 and that's it.

Examples include:\n\n- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions\n- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.\n- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.\n- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.\n\n**📘 The official documentation is available at [sinytra.org](https://sinytra.org/docs).**\n\nThe Forgified Fabric API (FFAPI) is a direct port of [Fabric API](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric) for the NeoForge\nmodloader, regularly kept up to date with the upstream repository. It is designed to make cross platform mod development\neasier by allowing developers to use Fabric API as a common library to interact with the game's code on both platforms.\nHowever, it is not an abstraction layer, and loader-specific code still needs to be handled separately for each\nplatform.\n\n### 💬 Join the Community\n\nWe have an official [Discord community](https://discord.gg/mamk7z3TKZ) for our projects.

The owner is the player who placed down the block. Only the owner of a block can interact with it, and only the owner can break it. Many blocks ignore their owner, meaning their functions do not apply to the owner, but only to other players. This behavior can be turned off per block in the screen that opens when rightclicking the block with a Universal Block Modifier. There is optional support for scoreboard team ownership, which can be enabled in the config. This results in every player on a team owning all blocks that were placed by a player who is also on that same team.\\\nIf you have a mod like *Jade* or *The One Probe* installed, you can see who owns a block in that mod's overlay.\n\n### Reinforced Blocks\nSecurityCraft adds reinforced blocks corresponding to many of the already existing vanilla blocks. These reinforced blocks are unbreakable variants of their vanilla counterpart, and have a slightly darker tint to distinguish them from, but otherwise look the same as, their vanilla versions. This tint can be turned off in the config file. Reinforced blocks are immovable by vanilla pistons, however they can be pushed by reinforced pistons.\\\nNot every vanilla block has a reinforced counterpart, and modded blocks are not and will not be supported by us. That said, there is an easy-to-use API for adding new reinforced blocks, and the team is glad to help out with using it for any mods that want to add reinforced blocks for their own or other mods' blocks.\\\nReinforced blocks are created by reinforcing them with a universal block reinforcer. The different levels simply have more durability, and level 2 upwards can also remove the reinforcement.\\\nHere's a player reinforcing their house:\\\n![In-world reinforcing](https://i.imgur.com/ciac7YL.gif)\n\n### Technical Blocks\nThere are numerous blocks added by the mod, which allow the player to secure their base from intruders. An exhaustive list would be too long for this description, so a few select blocks are outlined below to give you an overview of what to expect in the mod. For a complete list of all of the blocks and items in the mod you can check out the ingame manual, or the [mod's wiki](https://github.com/Geforce132/SecurityCraft/wiki).\n\n- **Block Change Detector**: The block change detector is able to detect block changes in a certain range around it, and will also log the position, player, time, and block state of the changed block.\n- **Fake Liquids**: They look like lava and water, but act completely differently.\\\n![Fake water hurts](https://i.imgur.com/IKUmDWB.gif)\n- **Inventory Scanner**: Previously configured by the owner to prohibit certain items, the inventory scanner can confiscate these prohibited items, or even not let a player having one of these items in their inventory through.\n- **Keycard Reader**: The keycard reader accepts a previously defined set of keycards, and will only emit a redstone signal when the correct card has been inserted.\n- **Projector**: Used to project fake blocks into the world.\\\n![Projector showcase](https://i.imgur.com/xmkz1wr.gif)\n- **Rift Stabilizer**: Can prevent teleportation attempts in its vicinity, disallowing players to use chorus fruit or enderpearls to teleport/glitch into one's base.\n- **Security Camera**: A camera that players can look through from anywhere in their world. Useful for keeping an eye on what those villagers are up to. Or maybe to spy on your enemies.\n- **Sentry**: A defensive device that shoots at approaching mobs.\n- **Trophy System**: Uses laser technology to explode incoming projectiles.\n\n### Modules\nMany of SecurityCraft's blocks can be modified in various ways. This is done through *modules*. They add additional functionality such as redstone output, or allowing the block to act faster than it would without the module. A notable module is the disguise module, which allows SecurityCraft's blocks to look like any other block in the game, allowing for stealthy base defenses.\\\n![Disguise module showcase](https://i.imgur.com/0QfSKPH.gif)\\\nAnother very useful module is the allowlist module, which enables the owner to list names of players in a block. These players are then ignored by the block, and any password-protection, targeting system, etc. that it has.\n\n### Passcode-protected Blocks\nThe mod adds a few passcode-protected blocks that can only be accessed by players who know a numerical code that was previously set by the block's owner. There are a couple passcode-protected blocks that work just like their vanilla counterparts. These blocks include a chest and different furnaces. Most of these do not have a crafting recipe, and are instead created by rightclicking their vanilla variants with a key panel.\nPasscode-protected blocks can be bypassed by the codebreaker. There is a 33% chance of the bypassing succeeding. The item has 3 uses, so handle with care! If the codebreaker is successful, the block will activate/open, and the player can access it.\nIf you have a mod like Jade or The One Probe installed, you can see the passcode of your own passcode-protected blocks. This can be turned off, and only the owner can see the passcode. As of SecurityCraft v1.9.7, no one can see the passcode anymore, not even with the help of mods.\n\n### Explosives\nThere are many mines added by SecurityCraft that players can use as defensive measures. A special type of mine are the so called block mines, which mimic commonly found blocks such as stone, dirt, deepslate, or sand, as well as all existing ores. These mines look just the same as their normal variants, however they are explosive to the touch. If a player who is not the owner breaks such a block mine, it will explode and leave a fiery crater.\\\n![Block mine showcase](https://i.imgur.com/MkJ0S4P.gif)\\\nThe mod also has other explosive gadgets. These include a standard mine that explodes when being stepped on, and a device that shoots mines at nearby mobs. All of these mines can be accessed by the mine remote access tool. Rightclicking a mine with the tool binds the mine to it, and subsequently allows to remotely defuse, arm, or detonate it.\n\n### Showcase\nNoxus created a very good showcase of the mod, highlighting key features and explaining the basics, as well as explaining all the blocks in the mod (as of v1.9.5).

information to tooltips:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YksBaUx.png)\n\n* Adds a visualization of saturation and exhaustion to the HUD:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tmImVqo.gif)\n\n* Adds a visualization of potential hunger/saturation restored while holding food:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aHf1QxQ.gif)\n\n* Adds a visualization of potential health restored while holding food:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jUOKFUl.gif)\n\n* Adds hunger/saturation/exhaustion info to the debug overlay (F3)\n* Syncs the value of saturation and exhaustion to the client.\n\n---\n\n### Misc\nYou are welcome to add this mod to any modpack you'd like.\n\n---\n\n### Use on vanilla servers\n\nOne of the following plugins can be used to get the saturation/exhaustion to work when connecting to vanilla Minecraft servers:\n\n- https://github.com/jmattingley23/AppleSkinSpigot\n-

🤔 What does this mod do?\n\nETF is a Fabric (Quilt compatible) & Forge mod that adds many new _Entity Texture Features_, including entity and player skin features!\nThis way, ETF achieves more OptiFine parity on the Fabric mod loader. If you want more OptiFine features on Fabric, you can either check [this list](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives), made by LambdaAurora, **or** you can use the [Fabulously Optimized modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), which includes **all** the OptiFine parity mods!\n\n### Featuring:\n\n- [🎲](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/RANDOM_GUIDE.md) Custom & random entity textures with the OptiFine format, including even more properties!\n- [💡](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/EMISSIVE_GUIDE.md) Emissive/glowing entity textures with the OptiFine format\n- [😑️](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README.md#-blinking-textures) Blinking mobs\n- [🎨](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/SKIN_GUIDE.md) Player skin features\n\n## Compatibility\n\n- OptiFine's random/custom or emissive entity resource packs - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatable**\n- [Entity Model Features (EMF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [dorianpb's CEM mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\">  **Fully compatible**\n- [Iris Shaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**<br />(Support varies depending on the shader)\n- Mod added entities - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Compatible**<br />(Only if the mod creator used the vanilla rendering code to render their mobs)\n\n## Settings & configuration\n\n- Settings can be changed in-game using [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), the settings button in the resource pack screen, or  by editing the config file, located under `config/entity_texture_features.json`\n- A few of these options can also be changed via the [Puzzle mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/puzzle)\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/raw/master/.github/README-assets/options.png\" alt=\"Options\" width=\"450\">\n\n## Mod support\n\n- This mod should be compatible with any mod added entities as long as they extend `LivingEntityRenderer` class for rendering and utilise it correctly\n- Any mod displaying an entity in a custom GUI can force the default texture by having the `entity.getblockstate` set to either `null` or of type `VOID_AIR`, the same can be achieved by settings the display mob's UUID to `UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes((\"GENERIC\").getBytes())`. \n\n## FAQ\n\n My entities are invisible/broken!\n\n> Custom Entity Models is not a feature provided by ETF. If your entities are invisible or look corrupted you'll need to instal my other mod [Entity Model Features EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) as well (this includes resource packs such as Fresh Animations). Keep in mind that the CEM mod is still in alpha development and may still occur issues.\n\n Blocks and items are not emissive!\n\n> ETF does not support emissive block and item texture, for that you'll need to install [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity).\n\n My game is lagging, help!\n\n> If you are experiencing lag please check your most recent log file to see if any errors are being logged, sometimes an incorrectly written properties file or missing textures may lag the system.\n\n It doesn't work!\n\n> Check if any issues are not actually a problem in the properties file, a few packs seem to be pointing to a texture that doesn't exist.\n So far all mob entities support random & emissive textures, but there may still be some quirks. If you find bugs you can either [report them in GitHub](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/issues/new?assignees=Traben-0&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+%22short+issue+description%22) or get support in the Discord server (linked on the top of the page).\n\n> Emissives are broken with Complimentary shaders, what do I do?\n\n>Complementary shaders has its own in-built emissive textures that usually work fine but will conflict with some resource packs. You can either disable Complimentary's emissives or ETF's emissives to fix this.\n\n My question isn't here!\n\n> Feel free to check ETF's [Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/rURmwrzUcz) to ask your

This effect stays even if you remove the mod. It can be changed in the config or by typing /gamerule naturalRegeneration true.  \nHealing can be done by using bandages or plaster. When you right click them in your inventory, you get a GUI where you can choose where you want to apply it.  \nYou will die as soon as your head or body health drop to zero.\n## DEBUFFS:\n\n\nCertain debuffs may apply when your limbs get damaged, so when e.g. your feet get damaged, you will get a constant slowness debuff, or when your head gets hit servere enough, blindness and/or nausea will apply for a short time.  \nAll debuffs can be supressed by morphine.

The whole tree will only break after a certain number of chops, and bigger trees require more chops. Inspired by mods like Treecapitator.\n\n#### Cool features:\n- Doesn't get too loud when breaking big trees\n- Works on mushrooms and fungi\n- Intelligently breaks leaves\n- Compatible with most modded trees\n\n#### Things to consider when lumberjacking:\n- Chopping trees doesn't require an axe, but will take a while without one\n- Chopping different blocks of the same tree will all contribute to bringing down the tree\n- Players can work together to chop down those big trees\n- Bigger trees require more total chops, but fewer chops per block*\n- Hold \"sneak\" when breaking a log block to break it normally\n\n_*By default, the number of chops required to fell a tree is computed logarithmically. Some example numbers are below. The number of chops can also be configured to scale linearly with the number of blocks to, for example, require one chop per block, or one chop per tree. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/hammertater/treechop#configuring-chop-counting-version-0130-and-later)._\n\n| Tree blocks |  Chops required |\n| ------------ | ---------------- |\n| 1  | 1 |\n| 3 | 3 |\n| 5 | 4 |\n| 10 | 7 |\n| 20 | 12 |\n| 50 | 19 |\n|100 | 25 |\n\n<details><summary>Compatibility:</summary>\n\n#### Special support for the following mods:\n- (1.18.2) [Tinker's Construct](https://modrinth.com/mod/tinkers-construct): broad axes perform extra chops. All axes perform more chops with \"expanded\" upgrades.\n- (1.18.2+) Silent Gear: saws perform extra chops\n- (1.18.2+) [Project MMO](https://modrinth.com/mod/project-mmo): chopping grants woodcutting XP\n- (1.18.2+) [Jade](https://modrinth.com/mod/jade), [WTHIT](https://modrinth.com/mod/wthit), [TheOneProbe](https://modrinth.com/mod/the-one-probe): show number of log blocks in trees and the number of chops needed to fell.\n\n#### Known issues:\n- (1.18.2 and earlier) Multi Mine: choppable blocks need to be added to Multi Mine's blacklist. This should be fixed for 1.19+ versions. See [#106](https://github.com/hammertater/treechop/issues/106).\n- Some modded trees leave floating blocks when felled. See [#44](https://github.com/hammertater/treechop/issues/44).\n\n_Want to make your mod compatible with TreeChop? See the [wiki](https://github.com/hammertater/treechop/wiki/Adding-compatibility-with-TreeChop)._\n\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>FAQ:</summary>\n\n#### 1. How do I turn off chopping?\nPress n to open TreeChop's in-game settings, then toggle off the \"chopping\" setting. A key can also be bound to toggle chopping without opening the settings screen; go to Options > Controls and find the section labeled \"HT's TreeChop\".\n\n#### 2. How do I keep chopping off and only turn it on while sneaking?\nBy default, sneaking inverts your current chop setting, so just toggle chopping off (press n to access the settings screen) so that chopping will be enabled by sneaking.\n\n#### 3. How do I keep chopping even when sneaking?\nPress n to open TreeChop's in-game settings, then toggle off the \"Sneaking inverts chopping\" setting.\n\n#### 4. How do I keep from chopping my house down?\nThere's a setting to disable chopping if the \"tree\" is not connected to leaves. Press n to open TreeChop's in-game settings, then toggle \"trees must have leaves\".\n\n#### 5. I started chopping my house down. How do I stop?\nIf you find yourself chopping a block when you just wanted to break it normally, try breaking the block while sneaking, or toggle off chopping (press n to access the settings screen).\n\n#### 6. I was chopping something and the game crashed! What's up with that?\nProbably the item you used to chop the tree doesn't play nice with TreeChop. Go to [your minecraft folder]/config/treechop-common.toml and add the item's registry name to choppingToolsBlacklist, or ask the server owner to, and then maybe let me know about the conflict and I'll try to fix it.\n\n#### 7. Why can't I chop anymore?\nMaybe chopping is turned off; press n to open TreeChop's in-game settings, then toggle on the \"chopping\" setting. If chopping is enabled and changing tools doesn't help, then there might be a conflict with another mod. If you send me a recent log, I'll try to fix it.\n\n#### 8. Why do some trees leave behind floating leaves when felled?\nEither\na) it's a modded tree and its leaves are not set up properly. Let me know what type of tree is misbehaving, and I'll politely inform the mod owners.\nb) there are too many leaves! You can increase the max number of leaves by going to [your minecraft folder]/config/treechop-common.toml and increasing maxLeavesBlocks.\n\n#### 9. Why do some trees leave behind floating logs when felled?\nEither\na) it's a modded tree and is weirdly shaped. Let me know, and I'll try to make TreeChop do a better job of detecting that type of tree.\nb) the tree is too big! You can increase the max tree size by going to [your minecraft folder]/config/treechop-common.toml and increasing maxTreeBlocks.\n\n#### 10. How do I disable mushroom and fungus chopping?\nGo to [your minecraft folder]/config/treechop-common.toml and change\n    blockTagForDetectingLogs = \"treechop:choppables\"\nto\n    blockTagForDetectingLogs = \"treechop:choppables_except_mushrooms\"\nIf you want more control over which blocks can be chopped, you have to make your own datapack and fiddle with the block tags (see https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tag for more info).\n\n#### 12. Why am I not seeing the [fill in the blank] feature?\nOnly the newest version of Minecraft 1.16 is fully supported. Some older versions, especially 1.12.2, lack some of the fancier features.\n\n#### 11. Can I include this in a modpack?\nYes!\n\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Sample configs:</summary>\n\n<details><summary>treechop-common.toml</summary>\n\n```toml\n[permissions]\n\n\t[permissions.choppingEnabled]\n\t\tcanBeFalse = true\n\t\tcanBeTrue = true\n\n\t[permissions.fellingEnabled]\n\t\tcanBeFalse = true\n\t\tcanBeTrue = true\n\n\t[permissions.sneakBehavior]\n\t\tcanBeNone = true\n\t\tcanBeInvertFelling = true\n\t\tcanBeInvertChopping = true\n\n\t[permissions.treeMustHaveLeaves]\n\t\tcanBeFalse = true\n\t\tcanBeTrue = true\n\n\t[permissions.chopInCreativeMode]\n\t\tcanBeFalse = true\n\t\tcanBeTrue = true\n\n[general]\n\t#If false, log items will be destroyed when chopping\n\tdropLootForChoppedBlocks = true\n\n[treeDetection]\n\t#Maximum number of log blocks that can be detected to belong to one tree\n\t#Range: 1 ~ 8096\n\tmaxTreeBlocks = 320\n\t#Maximum number of leaves blocks that can destroyed when a tree is felled\n\t#Range: 1 ~ 8096\n\tmaxLeavesBlocks = 1024\n\t#Destroy leaves when a tree is felled\n\tbreakLeaves = true\n\t#Non-decayable leaves are ignored when detecting leaves\n\tignorePersistentLeaves = true\n\t#Maximum distance from log blocks to destroy non-standard leaves blocks (e.g. mushroom caps) when felling\n\t#Range: 0 ~ 16\n\tmaxBreakLeavesDistance = 7\n\n\t[treeDetection.logs]\n\t\t#Blocks that should be considered choppable\n\t\t#Specify using registry names (mod:block), tags (#mod:tag), and namespaces (@mod)\n\t\tblocks = [\"#treechop:choppables\", \"#minecraft:logs\", \"#forge:mushroom_stems\"]\n\t\t#Blocks that should never be chopped, even if included in the list above\n\t\t#Specify using registry names (mod:block), tags (#mod:tag), and namespaces (@mod)\n\t\texceptions = [\"minecraft:bamboo\"]\n\n\t[treeDetection.leaves]\n\t\t#Blocks that should be considered leaves\n\t\t#Specify using registry names (mod:block), tags (#mod:tag), and namespaces (@mod)\n\t\tblocks = [\"#treechop:leaves_like\", \"#minecraft:leaves\", \"#minecraft:wart_blocks\", \"#forge:mushroom_caps\", \"minecraft:shroomlight\"]\n\t\t#Blocks that should never be considered leaves, even if included in the list above\n\t\t#Specify using registry names (mod:block), tags (#mod:tag), and namespaces (@mod)\n\t\texceptions = []\n\n[chopCounting]\n\t#Method to use for computing the number of chops needed to fell a tree\n\t#Allowed Values: LINEAR, LOGARITHMIC\n\talgorithm = \"LOGARITHMIC\"\n\t#How to round the number of chops needed to fell a tree;

close to you.\n\n↔ And if the zombies may seem to strong for you, you still have the config file to work with, playing with their health and damage!\nRotted looks beautifully with shaders and with other mods because this mod has huge compatibility with other mods even if, some of the shaders or mods may break the actual visual effect of the mobs or game effect.\nCredits:\n\n↔ Many thanks to

We want our content to be rich and easy to use at the same time, so many of the blocks in the same theme can be switched seamlessly within the game.\n\n## In-Development Stage Notice\n\nThe version for Minecraft 1.20.1 is a huge change as it has been moved from MCreator. This is a conceptual beta version. Some contents are still in development so you will see a lot of missing models in the game. We hope the players can enjoy this mod sooner so it's currently playable in Survival Mode!\n\nThe missing parts will be added in the future. In the meantime, we are eagerly looking for people to contribute to this project!\n\n## How to Play\n\nMany items can be crafted in stonecutter or more simply by using \"button 4\" on your mouse (by default) to seamlessly switch between them in hand.\n\n## Special thanks to the contributors:\n\nLittleBai, ustc-zzzz, LucunJi, 3TUSK, TartaricAcid, IzzelAliz, Gu-ZT, SettingDust, a1640727878,

of Sins: Wounds of Chaos","description":"💀Harvesting souls, organs and blood to give life to...","body":"[![](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/784/796/sons_of_sins_title.png)](https://youtube.com/shorts/KpZbZYZG10w?si=0bUNlZLWLkiBrjkw)\n\n\n**Sons of Sins is a mod based on the 7 deadly sins, especially the original sin. This mod considers that the original sin is to have taken oneself for God, wanting to create life by supernatural means, Necromancy. Harvesting souls, organs and blood to give life to a new form of life. But be careful, playing with occult energies involves many risks, one of which is called the \"Wistiver\" :)**\n\n**The mod adds many magical relics to facilitate gameplay in exchange for a little Ether ash.**  (install [JEI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei) to see all the recipes) \n\nI'm French and this mod was done with Mcreator (Sorry if I make mistakes in English) \n\n   \n**Warning : The mod has many sounds that could be called disturbing, or creepy. No human or animal were injured during Sons of Sins soun****ds recording.**\n\nAt night, you'll have the chance to meet a Betrayed Guzzler. This creature will drop you a Sickle and Flesh of Demise, which is a good start for the rest of the mod\n\n![](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/781/7/sons_of_sins13.png)\n\nDuring rituals, you will surely have the bad luck to meet one of these creatures (especialy if you like to swim in blood). You can summon them voluntarily by throwing and sacrifice between 1 and 7 villagers in blood. Each represents one of the seven deadly sins and each has a different behavior.\n\n\\-Wistiver (Gluttony, his attack and health increases every time he kills, he is hungry for power, his hunger will never be sated)  \n\\-Walking Bed (Sloth, slow, but its attack will send you waltzing so that there is more time to rest)  \n\\-Prowler (Pride, it never lets go, its speed will leave you speechless, weak but lively, flu on the ripe and will know how to make a mouthful of you)  \n\\-Kelvin (Envy, being jealous of these friends, he made a cybernetic prosthesis, which unfortunately only slows him down compared to these brothers)  \n\\-Curse (Lust, he will avoid the maximum of physical attack, preferring to look at you with his gaze, far in the air, to contemplate only you)  \n\\-Blüd (Greed, never comes out of its puddle, but is the most robust of all creatures, it will stay safe throwing balls of clotted blood at you)  \n\\-Butcher (Warth, he doesn't want the same as these friends, he doesn't want to purify the world, he wants to avenge it)\n\n![](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/819/651/sons_of_sins16.png)\n\nOnce killed, each sin creature drops a unique relic. The Wistiver's Jaws (Become stronger each stroke), the Puppet of Strife (it can use organ's capacities), the Hand of Riot (Make entities around target the enemy), the Ether Engine (Can corrupt the purest soul), the Cursed Head (Take ennemy's armor pieces off), the Touch of Greed (Make the ennemy go through the ground) and the Butcher Cleaver (Low is your health, stronger you will be)\n\n![](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/773/480/sons_of_sins12.png)\n\nThe mod adds osseous tools that are easy to craft (Bones and strings). These tools recovers part of the soul of the mobs you kill in the form of Ether Ashes. You will get it in proportion to the life of the mob yo would kill\n\n(Chicken: 1 Ash, Iron Golem: 10 Ashes, Wistiver: 86 Ashes)\n\n![](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/745/892/image1.png)\n\n With iron and Ether Ashes, you can make an alloy called Soul Steel. This metal is used in many recipes of the mod. As such, it can be used to make extremely strong blocks that can withstand Wither’s fiercest attacks \n\n![](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/745/893/image2.png)\n\n The mod adds a new tool, the Sickle of Struggle. It allows you to spam click (against a little of your food) but also to collect blood in glass bottles. Blood can be mixed with ashes in a bucket to create a bucket of blood (that can heal you)\n\n![](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/745/894/image3.png)\n\nFlesh tools are bone tools that have been thrown into the blood. They have low durability but are very effective and very strong. And every 15 seconds, a flesh tool will self-heal its durability by consuming your food bar (like xp with mending)\n\n![](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/804/767/sons_of_sins15.png)\n\nWith the sickle, you can get the organs of the enemies you killed (Flesh, muscles, ribs or hearts). Some mobs have different organs that have abilities from the mobs. You can eat organs to temporarily assimilate these abilities.\n\n\\-Classic organs give an effect of \"Allure\" (attracts the attention of monsters to prevent your friends from being targeted)\n\n\\-Creeper Ribs give an effect of \"Last Breath\" (causes an explosion if you die of another creature)\n\n\\-Enderman Muscles give an \"Instinct\" effect (teleports you if you are attacked with a slight damage reduction)\n\n\\-Blazing Heart gives an effect of \"Boiling\" (Rejects from time to time a cloud of steam that repels ignites entities around, if it rains or you are in the water, the cloud of steam remains around you)\n\n\\-Golem Cuirass cannot be eaten (But gives an effect of Resistance II and you imunise to fall damage)\n\n![](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/745/899/image8.png)\n\n With the fleshes and organs you have picked up, you can make a Flesh Carcass. Inside it, you can place the organs of your choice, an Ether Ash and a Bottle of Blood. Then the carcass can be dropped into a puddle of blood to give it life.\n\nOnce the ritual is over, a Gublèr will emerge from the fluid, and will take affection for the nearest player and adopt the abilities associated with the organs you gaved him\n\n![](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/745/900/image9.png)\n\nDepending on the blood you put into your Flesh Carcass, your little Gulbèr will adopt a different shape and abilities.  \n\\- A biped mob's bloods (Like Players, Villagers or Zombies) will make it faster and more resistant with a lot of health  \n\\- A winged mob's bloods (Like Bats or phantoms) will allow it to fly and bite ennemies to recover some hearts  \n\\- A water creature's bloods (Like Guardians, Dolphins or Fishes) will allow it to swim and avoid hurt cooldown to kill ennemies faster  \n\\- A wide and heavy mob's bloods (Like Ravagers or Hoglins) will make your friend an all-terrain mount that will crush the other creatures\n\n![](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/790/44/sons_of_sins14.png)\n\n To convert Ashes Ether into usable energy, you need Crystallized Ether (obtained by dropping 16 Ashes Ether into a pool of blood). Many relics of the mods need Ether to work, you can store these ashes in an Urn (The spiral in the center indicates whether it's filled or not)\n\n![](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/745/895/image4.png)\n\n The Ether Sword is a fairly light sword that allows to recover a part of the life of the enemy with each stroke (between 1 and 3 half heart).\n\n![](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/745/896/image5.png)\n\n The Shape-Shifting Tool is a relic that changes shape depending on the block you are mining. Therefore, it can destroy any type of blocks (Stone, Sand, Wood, Clay...etc)\n\n![](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/745/897/image6.png)\n\n Remnant’s armor is the most useful relic against the incarnations of the 7 deadly sins. It tankers the most brutal attacks from these creatures.

modification adds an infection to the world that spreads aggressive flesh.","body":"The Flesh That Hates\n\nExperience the true horror behind an assimilating infection!\n\n \n\nFace the unstoppable carnage that has been awakened in the world of Minecraft. You don't know exactly what it is, you don't know how strong it is, you don't even know if you'll be able to fight it back. But one thing is sure: THE FLESH MUST DIE!\n\nInfect your world!\n\n \n\nThe Flesh That Hates will infect your world. As soon as you hear a terrifying hum, it indicates the birth of a new Incubator. The longer an Incubator exists, the stronger the infection and the Incubator itself become. Fear will not save you, escape will not help, they will find you anyway.\n\nIncubators!\n\nIncubators are the beginning and the end of the entire infection. Incubators are capable of evolving, creating armies of flesh creatures, and much more unpleasantness.\n\n \n\nBiomass\n\n \n\nBiomass is a dynamic difficulty system which will affect the entire infection, punishes the players who ignore the infection and rewards the one who fight it. The Flesh will gain Biomass by doing different activities. Biomass enhances the flesh creatures in various ways, and it's up to you to find out how!\n\nThe Flesh has many ways to acquire biomass, at least through the killing of mobs.\n\n \n\nFight it back!\n\n \n\nHowever, the Flesh will lose Biomass by destroying it: Breaking blocks, killing flesh creatures or killing Incubators. Each action will vary differently in how much Biomass you take fron the Flesh. There's also a way to fight the Flesh back, but you'll need to find it. Don't worry, it is actually quite obvious\n\n**DISCORD LINK:**[https://discord.gg/QryK7xkZqW](https://discord.gg/QryK7xkZqW)","published":"2024-01-03T12:04:17.237598Z","updated":"2024-04-04T16:31:39.213352Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":9902,"followers":60,"categories":["equipment","mobs"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["VhcSyORG","pjL6b4sH","8g9cu75G"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/sGz64mG6/536e6a05eb6cb3bff3d4f3ac35f734727ff4fc64.png"},"version":{"id":"8g9cu75G","project_id":"sGz64mG6","author_id":"qVZJNpM6","featured":false,"name":"TFTH 1.1b","version_number":"1.1b","changelog":"**DELETE PREVIOUS CONFIG!**\n\nIn general, this is a bug fix for certain errors.\n- Now we have finally added our own Mob cap.

Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor.

Many modded crafting tables are supported by default, those that are not can be added to a custom config file found at <code>.minecraft/config/visual_workbench.json</code> (not accessible from in-game). If you add a crafting table yourself and it doesn't work it is likely incompatible with this mod.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Now that items stay in the table, clearing the interface is so tedious.

A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*.
